# About #
This is a program to test your arithmatic skills. It covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squares, square roots, exponents, and logarithms (in a way). They all involve only whole numbers beneath 10. 

# Usage #
Right now, it defaults to 5 easy questions (add, sub, mult, div), 5 medium (squares and square roots), and 5 hard questions (exponents and logs). It gives you your score, percentage correct, and some advice on what areas to improve (if you have much improving to do).

# Future #
I hope to expand difficulty beyond operation, i.e., a 3 digit addition problem is harder than a 1 digit multiplication problem,

I hope to add a forced diversity to the problems to prevent similar problems from occuring too often or in too close a proximity.
